RNCryptor-cpp
=============

C++ implementation of Rob Napier's RNCryptor

**Note:** This codebase is in early alpha stage. Don't expect it to do much yet.

To compile, run `make`. The executable is named `rncryptor`. It only runs tests
at the moment, but at least this way we can see what we still need to work on.
